# Title

this is a paragraph
and this is the same paragraph, even though it's on a different line.

new paragraph! this one has a [link to a website directly](https://www.google.com)
as well as a [named link](bing) to a worse website. Let's follow it up with a list:
1. in some
2. particular
3. order

And a new paragraph again, but this one will have a footnote{hello! I'm a footnote!}
and an unordered list:
* see?
* no particular order
* no sir!
* well there's still the implicit order but let's leave that be, shall we?

## subheading here.

_this text is underlined_, whereas ~this text is struck-through~. *this text is bolded*, whereas /this text is italicized/.
and =this text is <raw/>= unlike <here>!

In this paragraph, at long last, we come to the important part: `the code` (this last should appear monospaced).

{{{lang:python|numbers:no
# directives should appear in the {{{ line above, separated by '|' (pipe) characters.


# this should be treated as pre-formatted text; no eating of    whitespace or collapsing of newlines
# end a code block in the following way: }}}
}}}

and finally, we'll end with a little quote from a well-known fictional character:

>>> I'm just gonna take Sundays off for the _rest of time_. You should too!
>>> lolololol
[source: God]

>>> And another quote
>>> on multiple lines
followed by text??

God should be pictured here, for those of you who haven't seen God (all of you): [path/to/some/file.jpg]
